# Daniel's Nootropic Stacks
---
## Proceed with care and always start with lower doses
## Experiment and see what works for you

### Good Morning Stack / Study Stack | memory & focus
#### Start with lower dose, experiment and see what works for you the best
- 200mg+ of L-Theanine  
- 100mg+ of Caffeine (or drink a cup of coffee)
- 2mg+ of Nicotine (nicotine pouches reccommended)
##### L-theanine negates the jittery effect and heart-pumping the caffeine causes and multiplies the focus and memory effect

### Basic Vitamin Bomb | immunity, energy & vitality
#### This is just a list of what I recommend you to take daily for best health
- 4000IU+ of Vitamin D
- 100mg+ of Vitamin C
- 10mg+ of Zinc
##### Adjust to your enviroment. I live in the North where there is little sun so I do 8000IU min. daily
---
### Good Night Stack / Relax Stack | recovery & proper sleep
#### Again, start with lower doses and see what works for you
- 3g+ of Glycine (add up 3g daily until you reach 18g)
- Chamomile tea
- 25mg+ 5-HTP (50mg recommended, however might cause bad dreams for some people)
- 10mg+ Zinc
- 25mg+ Magnesium (magnesium prevents muscle stiffness, and heartattack is having your heart stiff since it is muscle as well - prevent it)
##### Be careful of 5-HTP and start low. Effects of glycine are to be seen after 2-3 days of taking it, so don't expect to sleep like baby immediately on the first day.
